          Why use a template instead of building from scratch?

          Discover the key benefits of using templates for your next web project
          — whether it&apos;s a landing page, an eCommerce site, or a full-stack
          dashboard.

        <div className="space-y-6 prose prose-neutral">
          <p>
            You have a product idea. You want to launch fast. But building
            everything from scratch? That’s a guaranteed way to burn time,
            energy, and money before you even validate anything.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whether you’re creating a SaaS, an eCommerce website, a personal
            portfolio, or a landing page, starting with a high-quality
            <strong> responsive website template</strong> can save you weeks of
            coding and layout styling — and put you on the fast track to
            results.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Launch faster</h2>
          <p>
            With templates built using <strong>Next.js</strong>,{" "}
            <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, and often Bootstrap, you benefit from
            responsive design, modular components, and performance optimization
            out of the box. Skip the frontend setup and go straight to building
            your product.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Battle-tested UX and UI</h2>
          <p>
            A great template includes polished UI components, modern layouts,
            intuitive navigation, and well-designed call-to-action buttons.
            Whether you&apos;re using them in a{" "}
            <strong>single-page application</strong> or a multi-page setup, the
            user experience is already optimized.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Lower your costs</h2>
          <p>
            A premium template gives you 80% of the work for less than 1% of the
            cost of hiring a freelance developer or design agency. Templates
            often come with reusable widgets, header/footer sections, and even{" "}
            <strong>SEO-friendly</strong> structure — all included.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Focus on what matters</h2>
          <p>
            Instead of spending weeks on CSS, layout, and{" "}
            <strong>responsive web design</strong> challenges, focus on what
            matters: content, product, and customers.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Scalable and developer-friendly</h2>
          <p>
            Templates on <strong>bloomtpl.com</strong> are made for real-world
            projects. Built with modern frameworks and best practices like{" "}
            <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong>,{" "}
            <strong>JavaScript</strong> frameworks, and{" "}
            <strong>modular CSS</strong>, they’re ready for customization and
            scale.
          </p>

          <h2>But… won’t my site look like everyone else’s?</h2>
          <p>
            Not if you customize it. A good <strong>page template</strong> is
            your starting point. You add your own content, branding, and logic —
            and turn it into a unique site or <strong>web application</strong>.
          </p>

          <h2>Choose quality. Choose speed. Choose results.</h2>
